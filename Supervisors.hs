Module: Supervisors
Description: Montior a pool of threads.

This module exposes a 'Supervisor' construct, which can be used to safely
spawn threads while guaranteeing that:

* When the supervisor is killed, all of the threads it supervises will be
  killed.
* Child threads can terminate in any order, and memory usage will always
  be proportional to the number of *live* supervised threads.

We also provide a 'TSupervisor' abstraction, which can be used to attach
threads to the 'Supervisor' from inside an 'STM' transaction.
